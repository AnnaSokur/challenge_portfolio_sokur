Task 1: Software configuration
“Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?”

Before I met Dare IT, I was doing a little marathon QA. I really enjoyed working with testing, looking for and describing errors, then completing various reports. I found it very interesting. I want to change my line of work, I want to have a job that I like and enjoy it. 

Ukraine is one of the leading countries in terms of the number of people working in the It-industry. I really want to go back home, live in the country I love the most, work, get a good salary, and later, just like you, help and educate people, help them change their lives. 

I may be new at the moment, and it's hard for all of us, but my global goals are moving me towards a big change. And I am sure we have a successful and happy future ahead of us.

Thank you very much for your support, work and kind words. 


With love,
Ania
